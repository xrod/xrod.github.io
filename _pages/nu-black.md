  NUBLACK is an ambitious two-year project hosted at the Astroparticle and Cosmology lab (APC) of the University Paris Cité. 
  
  The goal of NUBLACK is to identify multi-messenger signatures left by the interactions of ultra-high-energy cosmic-rays accelerated in the jets of active black holes. This effort requires state-of-the-art simulations based on my [open-source code AM3](https://am3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

  The project will result in key predictions for future facilities, such as IceCube-Gen2 and CTAO, helping to shed light on the long-debated origin of the ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.

  NUBLACK is supported by the investment program ‘France 2030’ launched by the French Government and implemented by the University Paris Cité as part of its program ‘Initiative d’excellence’ IdEx (ANR-18-IDEX-0001), which also funded the HERMES: multi-messengers of the Earth and the Universe project that contributed to this work.
