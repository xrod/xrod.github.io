# Project description (two paragraphs)
description: |
  NUBLACK is an ambitious research project aiming to identify the sources of ultra-high-energy neutrinos by combining multi-messenger observations with state-of-the-art simulations. We focus on active black holes as potential cosmic accelerators and use advanced machine learning techniques to analyze neutrino and gamma-ray data. 

  The project also explores the physical mechanisms of particle acceleration in jets, aiming to link theoretical predictions with observational data from IceCube, CTA, and other facilities. NUBLACK seeks to illuminate the hidden high-energy universe and deepen our understanding of cosmic accelerators.
