NUBLACK is an ambitious two-year project hosted at the [Astroparticle and Cosmology Lab (APC)](https://apc.u-paris.fr/en) of the [University Paris Cité](https://u-paris.fr/language/en/). 

The goal of NUBLACK is to identify multi-messenger signatures left by the interactions of ultra-high-energy cosmic-rays accelerated in the jets of active black holes. The project will exploit the potential of the new [open-source code AM3](https://am3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to perform cutting-edge numerical simulations of black hole jets.  

The project will result in key predictions for future multi-messenger facilities, such as IceCube-Gen2 and CTAO, helping to shed light on the long-debated origin of the ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.

NUBLACK is supported by the investment program [France 2030](https://anr.fr/en/france-2030/france-2030/) launched by the French Government and implemented by the University Paris Cité as part of its program ‘Initiative d’excellence’ [IdEx](https://u-paris.fr/language/en/universite-paris-cite-initiative-of-excellence/) (ANR-18-IDEX-0001), which also funded the *HERMES: multi-messengers of the Earth and the Universe* project.
