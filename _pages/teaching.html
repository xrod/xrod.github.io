### Courses developed and lectured

- [**Python for Physics (Ruhr University Bochum, 2019–2021)**](https://github.com/airub-multimessenger/py4phys-2022/tree/main)
  **Ruhr University Bochum**
  I designed and delivered a new Python course (150 students)
  The course was later integrated into the BSc Physics curriculum

- **Tutorials in Mathematics and Neutrino Physics**
  **(Humboldt University of Berlin, 2016–2019)**  
  I led student tutorials alongside lectures in mathematics and neutrino physics during my PhD at DESY.
<!-- 
### Guest lectures and contributions

- **ESO (since 2022)** — Lectured on multi-messenger astrophysics topics; teaching materials adopted by colleagues.  
- Contributed to specialized MSc/PhD lectures and seminars on astroparticle physics, cosmic rays, and blazars.

### Supervision

- **Extensive experience supervising MSc and PhD students**  
  Topics: astroparticle physics, neutrino astronomy, blazar modeling, multi-wavelength astrophysics.  
  Emphasis on student-driven projects that bridge particle physics and astronomy.
