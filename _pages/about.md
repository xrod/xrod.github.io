## Understanding active black holes with neutrinos and numerical modeling

I am a developer of [AMÂ³](https://am3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a word-leading astroparticle simulation framework, available as open-source Python software.


My latest manuscript, out August 2025: [Hillas meets Eddington: the case for blazars as ultra-high-energy neutrino sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18345) .
