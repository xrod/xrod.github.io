(2024)</a>, I modeled 324 blazars detected with the Fermi Large Area Telescope and showed that for one-third of the sample, proton interactions can help describe observations. The <a href='https://github.com/xrod/lephad-blazars'>results</a> and the <a href='https://gitlab.desy.de/am3/am3/-/blob/master/docs/examples/blazar_detailed_example.ipynb?ref_type=heads'>simulation flow with AM3</a> are publicly available."
